+ 🪨 `compute` – webworker files which respond to vectorize visual entry before morphing it

+ 🩻 `skeleton` – a set of *isolated* files working in separate dependency tree and *inlined* during build process into every `.html` file to provide instant animation.

+ 🖼️ `[pageName]` – includes skeleton structure, page assets, and usually `.html` file to enable multi-pageness to significantly improve loading time. 

+ 🧱 `render` – after page assets are loaded, construct and animate them.
