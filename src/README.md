## oleksii.xyz > 📂 **src**

`src` is the folder which contains main source files for the project

- 🪨 `compute/` - webworker files which process font files and vectorize them

- 🖼️ `content/` - files in this folder inline all necessary assets into a module

- 🧩 `modules/` - common script files which are required for most files and aren't tied to pages

- 📄 `pages/` - files which extend `entry.js` files by merging both page functionality and assets

- 🎨 `styles/` - mainly `.css` files for pages/modules
