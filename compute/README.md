## ðŸª¨ compute

intended to process vectors of elements before morphing them.

+â€‚`compute.ts`â€‚â€“â€‚handle requests and send to `fonts.ts` or `morph.ts`.

<br>

+â€‚`morph.ts`â€‚â€“â€‚controls the element vectorization process.

â€ƒâ€ƒ-â€‚`vectorize.ts`â€‚â€“â€‚vectorize every part of element.
 
â€ƒâ€ƒ-â€‚`skeleton.ts`â€‚â€“â€‚constructs rectangular paths from which elements morph during render

â€ƒâ€ƒ-â€‚`convert.ts`â€‚â€“â€‚recalculate path points so their number will be equal
 
â€ƒâ€ƒ-â€‚`normalize.ts`â€‚â€“â€‚arranges path points of both elemnts so they morph smoothly

<br>

+â€‚`fonts.ts` - preprocess `ArrayBuffer` into `opentype.js`'s `Font` object.
